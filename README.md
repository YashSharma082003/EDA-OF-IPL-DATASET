### What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical
process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover
patterns, to spot anomalies,to test hypotheses and to check
assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to 
analyze the data using visual techniques.
It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with 
the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.

### Steps invloved in EDA  :-
● Data Analysis (Data Pre processing, Cleaning and Manipulation).

● Data Visualisation (Visualize relationships in data using different types of plots).

### Python Libraries for EDA
Pandas is the most commonly used library for data analysis 
in python. There are tons of libraries available in python for data visualization 
and among them, matplotlib is the most commonly used. Matplotlib provides 
full control over the plot to make plot customisation easy,but what it lacks is 
built-in support for pandas. Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib 
and closely integrated with pandas.
